# PacMen.io
This project was an assignment for the MIT XPRO course. We were given some files and code to work with and 
Add a PacMan to the screen and watch them move around and bounce of walls by clicking Start Game. They will get faster everytime you click Start Game.
How to Run: You will need to press the add pacman button and start game button to get started. The add Pacman button will add a new pacman. The start game button will speed up the pace of the pacmen each time it is pressed. Have fun!
Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to work on getting the pacmen to change the direction they are facing an opening and closing their mouths.  
License information: This should include information about the MIT license.
