# PacMen.io
## Description:
This project was an assignment for the MIT XPRO course. We were given some files and code to work with and
## How to Run:  
Add a PacMan to the screen and watch them move around and bounce off walls by clicking Start Game. They will get faster everytime you click Start Game.
You will need to press the add pacman button and start game button to get started. The add Pacman button will add a new pacman. The start game button will speed up the pace of the pacmen each time it is pressed. Have fun!

Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to work on getting the pacmen to change the direction they are facing an opening and closing their mouths.
